# Netflix Movies Data Analysis - Beginner's Notebook
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a beginner's exploration of data analysis using Python libraries. The project uses a Netflix movies dataset to analyze movie durations and their potential relationship with release years.

## Purpose

Gain hands-on experience with data analysis tools: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, and matplotlib.
Explore data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization techniques.
Investigate a potential relationship between movie release year and movie duration.
## Content

Netflix_Beginner_project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook performing the following steps:
Import necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib)
Load the Netflix movies dataset
Perform basic data cleaning and exploration
Analyze movie durations
Create a scatter plot of movie duration vs. release year to visualize potential trends
Draw conclusions based on the analysis
## Findings:

This initial analysis did not reveal a clear relationship between movie release year and movie duration within the Netflix movie dataset.

## Future Work:

Explore other interesting questions from the Netflix dataset.
Analyze different data sources and delve deeper into data analysis techniques.
Build a portfolio of data analysis projects showcasing acquired skills.
### I hope this README provides a clear overview of the repository's purpose and content. Feel free to explore the notebook and learn alongside me in the exciting world of data analysis!
